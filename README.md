# Speech-Emotion-Recognition

This repository contains the implementation of a Speech Emotion Recognition system, which leverages machine learning to classify emotions based on speech data. The notebook showcases data preprocessing, feature extraction, and training of models for emotion detection.

Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a critical task in natural language processing that enhances applications in customer service, healthcare, and smart assistant technology. This project explores techniques to accurately classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- Feature extraction using Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)
- Model building and evaluation for speech emotion classification
- Visualization of results for insights into model performance
